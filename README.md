MuchConferenc.es
==========

A list of conferences that makers of websites, apps and other digital things might enjoy in 2015. We'll be adding more as we find them and of course tweaking things here and there.

Built with plain old HTML on the official SASS port of [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/). 

Want to contribute or tell us about your wonderful upcoming conference? Fork away (conference listing is pulled from "js/conferences.json"), send an email to **hi@muchconferenc.es** or ping [@muchconferences](http://www.twitter.com/muchconferences). PR's are most welcome.

See you at the coffee stand.
